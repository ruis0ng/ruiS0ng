## About Me

Hi! Iâ€™m currently a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science, and also a long-time Druid main in World of Warcraft.

**Guardian** is my favorite spec â€” I love being a reliable tank, always there for the team.  
My favorite form? Definitely the **Felhunter Bear**. That green glow? Iconic.

I try to bring the same mindset to how I work: steady, adaptable, and always happy to support my team however I can.

## Tech Stack & Experience

Iâ€™ve been learning full-stack development and have used:

- **Python**
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
- **FastAPI** for building lightweight backends
- **Vue.js** and **Next.js** for modern frontend development
- **Electron** for desktop app experiments
- **Docker** to containerize small projects

I enjoy exploring open-source projects â€” whenever I find something interesting online,
I like to try running it myself and dig around to see how it works.

## Why I Start a project

Most of my projects start with a simple idea or personal need â€” and a bit of curiosity.

For example:  
To help myself stay focused while coding, I built <a href="https://github.com/ruis0ng/FocusBloom">**FocusBloom**</a> â€” a minimal app that gives real-time visual feedback on my focus level, built with `Vue.js` and `Electron`.
